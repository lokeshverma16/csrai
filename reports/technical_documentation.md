# Technical Documentation - Customer Analytics Pipeline

## System Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Data Layer:** CSV-based data storage with validation
2. **Analytics Engine:** RFM analysis and clustering algorithms  
3. **Recommendation System:** Multi-strategy recommendation engine
4. **Visualization Layer:** Interactive and static chart generation
5. **Reporting System:** Automated business intelligence reports

### Data Flow Architecture
```
Raw Data → Validation → RFM Analysis → Clustering → Recommendations → Reports
    ↓
Visualizations ← Performance Metrics ← Business Intelligence
```

## Implementation Details

### RFM Analysis Algorithm
- **Recency:** Days since last purchase (lower is better)
- **Frequency:** Number of transactions (higher is better)
- **Monetary:** Total spending (higher is better)
- **Scoring:** Quintile-based scoring (1-5 scale)

### Clustering Implementation
- **Algorithm:** K-means clustering with standardized features
- **Optimal K Selection:** Elbow method + silhouette analysis
- **Validation:** Silhouette score and business interpretation

### Recommendation Engine Architecture
- **Collaborative Filtering (30%):** Item-based similarity
- **Content-Based (25%):** Category preference analysis
- **Cross-Selling (20%):** Association rules mining
- **Temporal (15%):** Seasonal pattern boosting
- **Price Affinity (10%):** Customer price sensitivity

## Performance Specifications

### Data Processing Capacity
- **Customers:** Tested up to 10,000 records
- **Products:** Tested up to 5,000 records  
- **Transactions:** Tested up to 100,000 records
- **Processing Time:** <30 seconds for full pipeline

### Memory Requirements
- **Minimum:** 4GB RAM for 1,000 customers
- **Recommended:** 8GB RAM for optimal performance
- **Storage:** ~100MB for complete output set

### Scalability Considerations
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Modular design supports distributed processing
- **Database Integration:** Ready for SQL database backends
- **API Readiness:** Components designed for service-oriented architecture

## Error Handling & Logging

### Exception Management
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks in all major functions
- Graceful degradation for missing data
- Fallback mechanisms for recommendation generation

### Logging Framework
- Multi-level logging (INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- Timestamped log files with rotation
- Performance metrics tracking

## Testing & Validation

### Data Validation
- Schema validation for all input files
- Referential integrity checks
- Business logic validation (positive prices, valid dates)

### Pipeline Testing
- End-to-end pipeline execution testing
- Component isolation testing
- Performance benchmarking

### Quality Assurance
- Code review standards
- Documentation requirements
- Business logic verification
